             <h1>School Life</h1>
             
             <h3>In my life, I've been to 4 different schools, a primary school in South Korea, Shelly Park Primary, Somerville Intermediate, and finally BDSC. In Korea, I only attended school for a year and a half, then I moved to NZ, and entered year 4.</h3> 
                 
             
<h3>At Shelly Park Primary, I began to learn English and by the time I left, I was able to speak English fluently. During primary, I also joined the basketball team, which is the main sport I play nowadays. From there, I moved on to Somerville Intermediate.</h3>

                 
<h3>Throughout intermediate, I expanded my range of sports, joining sports teams such as, volleyball, badminton, and futsal. In my second year, I was also able to become the class councilor, which gave me the opportunity to go on leadership camp and other authorities as a leader of a class. Finally, I joined co-curricular activities like, EPro8, Mathex, and Innovation.</h3>

                
<h3>After coming to BDSC, I've made a whole new set of friends, as most of my friends went to different schools. After trying out all the optional subjects, I decided to choose PED, DIT and TEM for year 10. So far, I'm enjoying all 3 of the subjects, and I hope it can carry on for the following years. </h3>
