            <h1>Cultural Background & Religion</h1>
   <h3> Being born in South Korea, and only moving here 6 years ago, I'm able to speak 2 languages fluently. At school, I speak English, and at home I speak a mix of both English and Korean. I would like to learn to speak another language such as japanese or chinese to be able to speak more languages and further develop my language abilities.
<br> <br> 
My religion is Christianity, and I have been since I was really young. My mum used to work at a church, and my grandfather is a pastor, which led to a christian environment around me. Ever since Covid-19, our family hasn't been able to attend church on a regular basis, due to lockdowns, social distancing and the distance of the church. So nowadays, we just do online sermons instead.</h3>
