            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>
    I was born on the 6th of September, 2008 in the capital city of South Korea, Seoul. I had a normal life in Korea, starting Primary and making friends. Then, when I was halfway through my 2nd year, my parents decided to move to NZ. After coming to NZ, I had learn how to speak English and had to make a completely new group of friends.

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <h3>
Most of my hobbies have to do with sports or physical activity, I mainly play basketball, and some other ball sports. When I’m not playing sports, I usually just go on my phone. My favourite subject at school would be P.E or maths. Ever since I was young, I’ve always been good at maths. For the last 4 years, I’ve been in the school Mathex team, and received a few awards for maths. </h3>
